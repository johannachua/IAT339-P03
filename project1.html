            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>This application was created from IAT 334, a course offered at SFU, that focuses on interaction design. Within the course, my team and I decided to create a user-content generated application where users can sign up to be safe houses for troubled lgbtqa+ youth, and youth who want to seek out these safehouses if they need refuge.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>I was responsible for creating a site map for the seeker. It was mainly used to help the team design for the user flow and highlight possible experiences, actions, thoughts, and as well as how the user would achieve their goal.</p>
            <p>Once the team refined the main user flow, I was then responsible for creating some mockups of the user interface. For example, I created the directions section of the app where the user would have to follow simple directions to get to their destination. I also animated the filters process to display how the filter process works after logging in the app.</p>
