            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>The case study video was initially challenging and intimidating because a
  previous co-op had initially started on animating the intro to the video. It was also
  difficult to understand the content because I did not have any science background.
  However, I was determined to adapt to the existing style that was created and at the
  same time implement the science background for the illustrations. With the help and
  guide of my colleagues, I was able to correctly apply the scientific content with the
  animations I made but also had the creative freedom that stayed within the constraints
  of the initial visual direction to complete the video.</p>
